# Guide to Python

Here are some resources to learn the basics of Python, its recommended program structure and the tools associated. This list contains repetitions and at the same time is not exhaustive, but provides a good entry point to understand and makes the things better.

## Python Basics

### Learn to code in Python

If you are not familiar with Python, [this page](https://docs.python-guide.org/intro/learning/) listed various resources to dive into this programming language. Here are some good resources to start with :

- [https://www.learnpython.org/](https://www.learnpython.org/) : a clear and interactive way of learning Python
- [https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html) : the official documentation, exhaustive but harder to read

### Python style guide

- [Summary of style recommandations](https://docs.python-guide.org/writing/style/)
- [Official style recommandations](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)

### Documenting

- [Documenting Python Code: A Complete Guide](https://realpython.com/documenting-python-code/)
- [Python Docstrings](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-docstrings/)
- [Les docstrings en Python (FR)](http://sametmax.com/les-docstrings/)

## Project Structure

We will distinguish the general structure of programs (not related to languages) from the Python specific case.

### Program structure in general

Design patterns could be a full course, so here is an introduction to design patterns : [10 Common Software Architectural Patterns in a nutshell](https://towardsdatascience.com/10-common-software-architectural-patterns-in-a-nutshell-a0b47a1e9013).

We will most probably use the MVC (Model View Controller) pattern.

### Flask project structure

A Flask project has its own particularities, the basic ones needed to participate in the repository are :
