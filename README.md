# Agile Crowd Counting

The purpose of this repository is to exercise Agile projects methods, as part of the Budapest University of Technology and Economics course [*Agile Network Service Development*](https://www.tmit.bme.hu/vitmma01?language=en).

## Objectives

It's main objectives (beyond applying Agile) are the following :

- creating a program that outputs the number of persons in a crowd from a picture
- creating a web application that allows users to manually count people in a crowd picture
- keeping trace of user actions (eg : how much people did each user count ?)

## Educational purpose

Because this project has above all an educational purpose, it contains a [guide](./guides/guides-summary.md) folder with various resources to learn the basics of Python, git, CI/CD... and all the other important notions concerning the project.

This is part of the "knowledge-sharing" philosophy, which is a part of Agile method too.
